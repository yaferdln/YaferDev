export const aboutText = `Hi, I'm Yafer — a passionate Web Developer with a background in IT Support.

After working for two years as an IT Support Assistant at the Manila International Airport Authority, I took a leap into the world of business and cryptocurrency. It was an exciting yet unpredictable journey. I learned a lot, but also went through a lot — losing a small business, a past relationship, and financial stability. There were moments when I felt lost, unmotivated, and unsure of my direction.

Still, I kept going. I tried becoming a content creator, teaching others about crypto to help them avoid the same pitfalls I faced. But soon I realized that relying solely on content and airdrop incentives wasn’t enough. That’s when I looked back and asked myself: What was the one thing I’ve always wanted to do?

The answer was clear — to become a web developer.

Creating websites has always been a dream of mine. I’ve always been fascinated by how platforms like Facebook or Twitter were built. Now, at 27, I’ve made the decision to restart my journey — this time with clear focus and purpose.

Right now, my main goal is to become a Front-End Developer. I'm focusing on mastering the craft of building clean, modern, and user-friendly interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap. While doing this, I’m also slowly diving deeper into backend development — learning Node.js, Express.js, and MySQL — because I know there’s still so much more to learn.

This is just the beginning. From restart to full-stack, I’m taking it one line of code at a time.

With every step, I bring with me the lessons from my past, and the hope that through dedication, continuous learning, and support from future clients or companies I may work with, I’ll be able to create solutions that truly make a difference.

Let’s build something meaningful — together.`;
